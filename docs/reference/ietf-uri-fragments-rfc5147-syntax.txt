   464  3.  Fragment Identification Syntax
   465  
   466     The syntax for the text/plain fragment identifiers is
   467     straightforward.  The syntax defines four schemes, 'char', 'line',
   468     and integrity check (which can either be 'length' or 'md5').  The
   469     'char' and 'line' schemes can be used in two different variants,
   470     either the position variant (with a single number), or the range
   471     variant (with two comma-separated numbers).  An integrity check can
   472     either use the 'length' or the 'md5' scheme to specify a value.
   473     'length' in this case serves as a very weak but easy to calculate
   474     integrity check.

   485     text-fragment   =  text-scheme 0*( ";" integrity-check )
   486     text-scheme     =  ( char-scheme / line-scheme )
   487     char-scheme     =  "char=" ( position / range )
   488     line-scheme     =  "line=" ( position / range )
   489     integrity-check =  ( length-scheme / md5-scheme )
   490                          [ "," mime-charset ]
   491     position        =  number
   492     range           =  ( position "," [ position ] ) / ( "," position )
   493     number          =  1*( DIGIT )
   494     length-scheme   =  "length=" number
   495     md5-scheme      =  "md5=" md5-value
   496     md5-value       =  32HEXDIG
