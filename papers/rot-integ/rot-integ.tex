\begin{abstract}

Radiant object theory \cite{ROTI}, topology \cite{ROTY}, applications
\cite{ROTA}, continuity \cite{ROTC}, and security \cite{ROTS} opened a
perspective on social peer trust networks.  This effort is a
continuation of that examination.

\section{Character}

The integrity of actor or network might be qualified as {\it
  intentional} or {\it extentional}.  An intentional causality is a
success of integrity.  An extentional causality is a failure of
integrity.  The distinction is inclusive of both physical and
metaphysical integrity.

The extentional violation of the metaphysical integrity of an {\it
  individual} would be psychological.  The extentional violation of
the physical integrity of an {\it actor} would be subterfuge.

A simple and effective comprehension of logical integrity serves the
nano-economics of link integrity \cite{ROTS}, and thereby the
macroscope of network integrity.
