\begin{abstract}

Radiant object theory \cite{ROTI}, topology \cite{ROTY}, applications
\cite{ROTA}, and continuity \cite{ROTC} opened a perspective on social
peer trust networks.  This effort is a continuation of that
examination of radiant object systems.

\section{Structure}

If communications link privacy is guaranteed by the padded pad

\begin{verbatim}
  oaep b<m>:pk b<n>:k
  oaep b<m>:pt b<n>:t
  xor b<m>:pm b<m>:pk b<m>:pt
\end{verbatim}

the shared secret key material requires private production and
sharing.  Perhaps a duplex infrared serial port is employed for
sharing the secret key material that is part of the guarantee of link
privacy.

The inconvenience represented by the maintenance of key material
includes the metaphysical work of organizing key material maintenance
and the physical work of performing key material maintenance.

The nano-economics of key material become the nano-economics of link
communication in practice.  Using these links for package broadcast
reaching is expensive in terms of padding.

The nano-economics of padded links illustrates the dynamics of social
mesh internetworking.  Network bandwidth is {\it link} scarce.
