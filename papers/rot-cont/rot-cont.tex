\begin{abstract}

Radiant object theory \cite{ROTI}, topology \cite{ROTY}, and
applications \cite{ROTA} opened a perspective on social peer trust
networks.  This effort is a continuation of that examination of
radiant object systems.

\section{Structure}

The partial object distribution \((\omega\delta)\) available to social
trusted peer \((\tau\kappa)\) package networks is incomplete object
reachability.  The retrieval of any particular package object in the
network depends on a physical peer contact and a mechanical peer link
\((\lambda\kappa)\).  Extended reachability is available {\it via}
demand package broadcast subject to link, store, and forward
constraints.

$$
 0 \le \frac{\omega\delta}{\lambda\kappa}
$$

Applications dependent on object ordering include geographic layers.
This continuity is a relationship among distributed objects.

Partial object distribution is discontinuous.  Applications of peer
contact and peer group distribution include social and mesh networks.
Social mesh continuity is physical.

$$
 1 = \frac{\lambda\nu}{\lambda\kappa}
$$
